# PresentMon Quick Launcher
With this Python Script you can launch the PresentMon console Application in a quicker fashion with given parameters like the Application name.

Usecases are:
- Launch the PresentMon console application with the Parameters you need it to start with every time.

You will need to download the PresentMon Application from [this](https://github.com/GameTechDev/PresentMon) Github repository to make use of this script here. This script will by default use "C:\Program Files\Intel\PresentMon\PresentMonConsoleApplication", as this is the default directory chosen by Intel where the CLI application lies after installing PresentMon, you can change this directory inside the script itself if you wish to do so.

Intel does require you to launch the CLI application as Admin, to make this more seamless right click the CLI application and toggle "Run this program as an administrator" on to have the script launching the CLI application as admin every time by default.
